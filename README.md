# Cryptography
This repository contains [problems](http://cryptopals.com/) in cryptography that I'm attempting to solve to further my knowledge of the subject. All solutions are in `OCaml`, a functional programming language.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for the code structure for my personal improvement. I would love to know ways I can optimize my strategies or organize my functions better or even develop better style!
