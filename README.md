# Cryptography
This repository contains [problems](http://cryptopals.com/) in cryptography that I'm attempting to solve to further my knowledge of the subject. All solutions are in `Kotlin`, a programming language on the JVM with functional features. I previously solved some of these problems in `OCaml`, a functional programming language; this earlier approach can be found in the archive folder.

My approach to cryptography is based on the Cryptopals cryptography questions, which in turn are based on the Matasano cryptography problems. I hope to get through Set 8 eventually. The topics that these problems broadly cover include, but are not limited to:

 * Basics (XOR, conversions, etc.)
 * Block cryptography
 * Stream cryptography
 * Randomness
 * Diffie-Hellman and similar methods
 * RSA and DSA
 * Hashes
 * Abstract algebra

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for the code structure for my personal improvement. I would love to know ways I can optimize my strategies or organize my functions better or even develop better style!
